        <p>Our father was an ancient river god. We, his fish, speared by his glance, gutted â€˜til our mangled hearts bled, steeped in his ale-soused breath. Our mother, a river nymph, soothed the torrent to keep us afloat in our fragile paper boats.

He turned younger through the years, through our unmooring, softer and dryer, until we aged past him.

We fidget, watch his body drift, forget its strength, his eyes losing themselves in quilt patterns. We cast our old answering-back voices about over his head. Pinch his fingers, hard. Trying to bait the fierceness we were once so afraid of.</p>
